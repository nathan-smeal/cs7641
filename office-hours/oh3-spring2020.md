## Piazza interesting points

* Max depth is a method of pre-pruning, not post pruning; care more about this for DT's over boosting
  * Seems to want things like leaf number and others to be used in complexity analysis and post pruning exhibited in DTs as well
  * Max depth is somewhat considered a hyper parameter
