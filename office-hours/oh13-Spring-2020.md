# Office hours #13

This is a short one

* A4 will be out around end of next week(right before exam)
* Problem set partial credit?  Not really graded, just checking for effort (3 qs)
* ML vs AI vs RL
  * AI is a broader term for solving a problem (not exact definition) it's a family that includes the others
* Major takeaways for this course?
  * The approach for supervised vs unsupervised
  * logical steps will be the same as this course
    * generalizability tradeoff
    * metrics to use
    * bias vs variance
  * will learn a lot of other techniques (this was a survey)
* Will RL be as popular as deep learning?  
  * Kind of entangled
  * Yes
  * depends on application
* Q4 - NLP stuff?  no answer not sure
* Q learning - visit all states infinitely often then converge to optimal solution
  * Structure of problem could limit this
  * not realistic
  * have to account for note being able to do that
* F4 - link for final?  will be setup this weekend before and a big post on monday
* F5 - see solution for details
  * PS2 problem 5
    * Mostly talking about how you set up the problem.
    * 2 states laughter or silence
    * 2 actions incense or organ
    * rewards based on state entered
    * not stochastic
    * have to do the transition matrix (make assumptions
  * problem 6
    * calculated the value for state 1 and state 2 prime??
    * total exploration and greedy exploitation case
    * state 2 prime and state 3 prime there is X % and etc then utility of zero
* F6 - question about due date, no extension , not relevant to anyone reading these notes
  * though DO MAKE SURE AND CHECK THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR FINAL EXAM DUE DATE 
* F7 - Reading a chapter that's not really relevant stick to what is in annoucement
  * sounds like one of the book chapters wasn't relevant
* Final tips?
  * rubrics?  format will be similar to midterm
    * won't be asked to derive mathematical or do proofs
    * keep in mind important equations
    * problem set 1 relates to midterm will be similar to ps2 and final
* Will iterative map of pi and vi
  * won't need to reproduce?
  * be able to compare and contrast
  * make sure and undertand them
  * sounds like it will be property based
