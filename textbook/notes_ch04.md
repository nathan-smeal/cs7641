Chapter 4: Artificial Neural Networks
=================================

ANN's are robust to errors in training sets and adept at visual scenes, speech recognition, and learning robot control strategies.

4.1-4.2 ANN Introduction and Representation
------------------------------------

Robust for lerning with real, discrete and vector values target functions.  Complex real world sensor data, including visual data, is one of the most successfully solved by ANNs.
